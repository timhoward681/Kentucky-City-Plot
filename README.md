Kentucky City Plot

My project combines a map of Kentucky and plot points for cities in Kentucky. My primary goal is to get some level of understanding with Python, GeoPandas, and Jupyter Notebook. My future goals are to create a quick way to tell basic distances between an origin city and subsequent cities in a state with the data uploaded via spreadsheets. This will be useful for a project manager in the trucking industry who quickly wants to figure how many drivers live around a project origin city.


Features used in this project:

1.)Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application

2.)Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data

3.)Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display
